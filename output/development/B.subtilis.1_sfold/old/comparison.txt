Expected stems: 
[6[5[1]]]

Observed stems:
[([6[5]]/[11])[1]]* - matches expected when accounting for functionally similar group 
    (order of nesting must be checked, output indicates 1 is on outside, should be on inside)
stems including non featured helices

Results of stems:
stems found are as expected


Expected functionally similar groups:
possibly 6/11 or [6[5]]/11 ->in which case, predicted stem is changed to [(6/11)[5[1]]] or [([6[5]]/[11])[1]]* 
7/8 considered but ruled out on basis of occuring together too frequently

Observed functionally similar groups:
[6[5]]/11
7/8 
functionally similar groups including non featured helices

Results of functionally similar groups:
7/8 should have been ruled out based on frequency of common occurence, must be looked at
Otherwise matched expectations

*notation needs work for functionally similar groups including stems
